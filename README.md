# RON in TensorFlow: Reverse Connection with Objectness Prior Networks for Object Detection 

RON is an object detection system for efficient object detection framework as descibed in [This CVPR paper](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Kong_RON_Reverse_Connection_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf). 

This repository contains code of the re-implement of RON following the above paper.

The code is modified from [SSD-Tensorflow](https://github.com/balancap/SSD-Tensorflow). You can use the code to train/evaluate a network for object detection task. 
For more details, please refer to [README of SSD-Tensorflow](https://github.com/balancap/SSD-Tensorflow/blob/master/README.md).
